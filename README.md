# MATH-340 Term Project: SpotSeeker 🅿️ 🔍

## Usage

Navigate over to `SpotSeeker-Full-App.ipynb` and run any of the use-cases (1-4) as mentioned in the paper. If you'd like to test it out yourself, add a new case, with a specific set of inputs (warning: no thorough input validation has been implemented, and data quality of TomTom should be quickly double checked with a print statement).

**Note** - you will need to sign up for an API key at TomTom Developers, before you can run the code. Furthermore, it is important to define a `config.py`. This contains sensitive information, so has been excluded from our repo. With any errors that complain about a missing config.py file, define one according to `sample_config.py` and also specify the correct API key.

## Side Note: Computational Environment

While implementing the app, we used conda environments and installed necessary packages using anaconda (or pip in 1 case).
